# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Utilizing MongooseDB, PostMan, GitHub and Javascript, the project aims to set up security messaging and testing while working with databases. The overall goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization. This includes building out routes and controllers to manage errors and requests to the API database.

## Running the Project
